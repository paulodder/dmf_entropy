* Setting up
Instructions and code will be made available shortly.
* Requirements
You need to have a working =MATLAB= installation.
** dotenv
This repository uses a =.env= file, in which variables specific to the machine
are stored. Add a =.env= file in the root directory of the project (i.e. the
same directory in which the =README= is located), and define the following
variables:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/this/directory/
DATA_DIR=/path/to/this/directory/data/ # in which data is stored
SRC_DIR=/path/to/src/directory # path to which you want to install additional packages (mine is /home/paul/src)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then install [[https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/108029-matlab-dotenv][=matlab-dotenv=]] by running the following in a =MATLAB= shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
eval(webread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roslovets/matlab-dotenv/main/installer/installweb.m'))
#+END_SRC
** fastdmf
This repository uses the [[https://gitlab.com/concog/fastdmf][fastdmf]] package. To install, run (starting from this
directory):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source .env
cd $SRC_DIR
git clone https://gitlab.com/concog/fastdmf
#+END_SRC sh
And to install the dmf package:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd fastdmf/matlab
mex COPTIMFLAGS="-O3" DMF.cpp
#+END_SRC
Then make sure to add this directory to your path in =MATLAB=:
#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
addpath(fullfile(dotenv.read().SRC_DIR, 'fastdmf', 'matlab'))
savepath()
#+END_SRC
